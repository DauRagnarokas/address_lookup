Ideally, the assignment should NOT take more than 4 hours. Anything that you think can be left out, add a `//TODO` on the comments and say what you would have implemented, had you had the time. 

## ☑️ Acceptance criteria

- Implement the code in the address screen, in order to retrieve the user address
- Store user address in an object
- Follow the design of the screenshot  
- Implement validations for the fields e.g. for street address the `subarea-block-house` format is expected
- (optional, but we'll be impressed!) The country dropdown should show all the possible countries in the world with their flags and autocomplete the user's choice

## 📦 Deliverable

Once you finish the assignment, create a .zip file with the finalised code and send it to us via email. Add a NOTES.txt file in the zip with any notes that you might want to add. Feel free to add the `.git` folder, so we can check your commit history.
